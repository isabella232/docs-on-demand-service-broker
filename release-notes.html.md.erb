## <a id="release-notes"></a>v0.27.0
**Release Date: April 4, 2019**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> To support multiple stemcells for a service deployment,
  the On Demand Services SDK has replaced <code>ServiceDeployment.Stemcell</code> with <code>ServiceDeployment.Stemcells</code>.
  For more information,
  see <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-cf/on-demand-services-sdk/commit/f88592e968ebb3a327d5689ed6772268a2c0fcfc">[BREAKING CHANGE]
  SDK now supports multi-stemcell deployment</a> in GitHub.</p>

  <p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> To support BPM for the broker, the BPM release must be included in the broker job. Also, because BPM restricts access to the current job, the broker needs to signify to BPM that it needs access to the service adapter config. For this, the `broker` job's `service_adapter` configuration must specify the `mount_paths` to the service adapter. An example of this configuration can be found in the manifest snippet in [Starter Snippet for Your Broker](#broker-starter-snippet).
 </p>

### Features

New feature in this release:

- The on-demand broker (ODB) now supports service instance deployments that use different stemcells for different instance groups.
- The broker binary adopted [Bosh Process Manager](https://bosh.io/docs/bpm/bpm/) (BPM) for better job isolation and security.
