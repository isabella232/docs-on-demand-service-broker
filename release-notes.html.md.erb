### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

- An issue with BOSH CredHub v1.9.11 and v2.1.5 causes an error after clicking **Apply Changes**.
  These versions of CredHub are included in Ops Manager v2.2.21, v2.3.15, v2.4.9, and v2.5.2.<br><br>
  To avoid this error, use CredHub v1.9.12 or later (included in Ops Manager v2.2.22
  or later and v2.3.16 or later) or CredHub v2.1.6 (included in Ops Manager v2.4.10
  or later and v2.5.3 or later).
  For more information about this error, see [Unable to Render Templates for Job CredHub](troubleshooting.html#credhub-error).

- Contacting BOSH Director Links API too many times in parallel can cause some requests to fail during operations such as bind and unbind.
