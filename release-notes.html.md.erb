**Release Date: July 12, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

**Indicator Protocol**

* The broker now publishes the number of service instances created for each service
and each plan to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Healthwatch service.
For more information about Healthwatch, see
[Pivotal Cloud Foundry Healthwatch](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/index.html).

To enable this feature, indicators have been added to the on demand broker release.
For more information about indicators, see the
[monitoring-indicator-protocol](https://github.com/pivotal/monitoring-indicator-protocol)
repository in GitHub.

**Resource quotas**

* The format for setting resource quotas in the manifest has changed.
For instructions, see [Setting Resource Quotas](operating.html#service-resource-quotas).
This release still supports the previous format, however, Pivotal plans to remove
support for the previous format in a future release.
* The broker now emits metrics for global and plan resource quotas.
For more information about these metrics, see [Metrics for Monitoring an On-Demand Broker](monitor.html).

### Known Issues

* If you include `null` plans in your service catalog definition, the broker will fail to deploy. This issue will be fixed in the next release.
