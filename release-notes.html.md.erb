## <a id="0-32-0"></a>v0.32.0

**Release Date: August 28, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Modified the `upgrade-all-service-instance` errand to go through Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) when that is the platform used and the `maintenance-info` property is configured.<br>
For older versions of the broker, the errand always goes through BOSH when the platform is PCF.
* SDK users can set `update_mode` in the BOSH `variables` block.
This is the preferred method to regenerate credentials and should be used instead of `converge-variables`.<br><br>
For information about `update_mode`, see [Variables Block](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2/#variables) in the BOSH documentation.<br>
For more information about `converge-variables`, see [Features Block](https://bosh.io/docs/manifest-v2/#features) in the BOSH documentation.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issue:

* Contacting the BOSH Director links API many times in parallel can cause some requests to fail during operations such as bind and unbind.

* If the broker is configured with `maintenance_info` and Cloud Foundry uses it,
the `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand upgrades each instance using only Cloud Foundry.<br><br>
Cloud Foundry does not upgrade instances with changes to BOSH because those changes are
not represented in `maintenance_info`.
Changes to BOSH include changes to add-ons, the Director runtime config, and CredHub.
