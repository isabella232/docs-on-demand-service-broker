## <a id="0-21-2"></a>v0.21.2 Release Notes

**Release Date: May 14, 2018**

### <a id="minimum-version-requirements"></a>Minimum Version Requirements

- BOSH 257+ (261+ for lifecycle errands) / BOSH lite v9000.131.0
- CF 238+

### <a id="breaking-changes"></a>Breaking Changes

- Plan-level `pre-delete` and `post-deploy` lifecycle errands value
  must be an array.
- Service instance provision requests now require `X-Broker-API-Version: 2.13`
  in the header for OSBAPI compliance. The version must be 2.x and later.
- When service instance quotas are reached, error messages are updated to the following format:
    `Global instance limit exceeded for service ID: SERVICE-ID. Total instances: NUMBER`

    <br>For example:<br>
    `Global instance limit exceeded for service ID: p.redis. Total instances: 100`


### <a id="new-features"></a>New Features

- Golang downgraded to 1.9.5
- Adds support for defining multiple pre-delete and post-deploy lifecycle
  errands. Errands can be configured with different colocation preferences.
  For more information, see [Service Instance Lifecycle Errands](./operating.html#lifecycle-errands).
- Improved flexibility to select canary service instances to upgrade
  during `upgrade-all-service-instances` errand. Operators can specify a number
  of instances to upgrade first, and/or they may specify a Cloud Foundry
  organization and space from which canary instances will be selected.
  Alternatively, arbitrary parameters can be supported if using
  the Service Instances API.
  For more information, see [Upgrade All Service Instances](./operating.html#upgrade-all-instances).
- Enabled broker validation for plan-level [configuration parameter schemas](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#catalog-management).
  Service adapters may opt into having ODB validate request configuration
  parameters by turning on the `enable_plan_schemas` feature flag and
  implementing [`generate-plan-schemas`](./creating.html#generate-plan-schemas).
- Improved status messages for `upgrade-all-service-instances`.
- Improved error messages for CredHub misconfiguration in service broker
  manifest. If the setting `secure_binding_credentials.enabled: true` is specified, then ODB
  validates that CredHub links are provided and resolvable from Runtime deployment.
- `PATCH /v2/service_instance/:instance_guid` and
  `PUT /v2/service_instance/:instance_guid` are fully compliant with
  [OSBAPI v2.13 specification](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md).
- Supports arbitrary additional properties in
  [service plan definition metadata](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/profile.md#service-metadata).
- CF CLI bumped to v6.36.1
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: PCF 1.10 integration is no longer supported. </p>
