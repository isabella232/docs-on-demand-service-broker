## <a id="0.29.1"></a>v0.29.1

**Release Date: May 29, 2019**

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* The `register-broker` errand no longer prevents registration because of missing plans.
  This regression impacted deployments that use Pivotal Application Service (PAS).
  Enterprise Pivotal Container Service (Enterprise PKS) deployments were not affected by this issue.
* The `deregister-broker` errand no longer fails when the broker does not exist.
  This fix causes the errand to behave like other broker errands do in this situation.
* The `delete-all-service-instances` and `delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker`
  no longer fail when encountering a service instance that is already being deleted. The errands now skip such instances and continue to issue delete commands for the remaining instances.
* The Broker API version information in request headers is now validated more consistently. This is due to the
  removal of a broker regression.
* Errors caused by JSON Schema Validation during create, update, and bind errands are now surfaced to platform
  users.

### Known Issues

There are no known issues for this release.

**Release Date: May 22, 2019**

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> If you set <code>cf_service_access</code> to <code>org-restricted</code> in the <code>
  register-broker</code> errand, you must set <code>service_access_org</code> in
  each plan in the broker service catalog.
For an example of a plan configured as <code>org-restricted</code>, see <a href="./management.html#register-broker">Register Broker</a>.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> You can no longer set service access for all plans with the <code>enable_service_access</code> property. This property has been removed. You must set service access for individual plans with <code>cf_service_access</code>. This property defaults to <code>enable</code>. For more information about configuring service access for plans, see <a href="./management.html#register-broker">Register Broker</a>.</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- The `register-broker` errand is no longer a bash script. It is now a golang binary. This enables the team to better test functionality and remove unnecessary dependencies. <%# Which team? %>
- `maintenance_info` includes a `version` property.
Operators can implement the functionality needed to expose this feature. For more information about this
feature, see [(Optional) Maintenance Info](operating.html#maintenance). <%# What does the second sentence mean? %>
- You can pass a `?force=true` query parameter to force delete a service instance. <%# For more information, see [SOMETHING]().%>

<%# The below needs to be on its own page. Also what does this mean:
If a BOSH service deployment becomes unresponsive and the broker's
standard delete request fails, passing `?force=true` as a query parameter to the
deprovision endpoint issues a force delete for the BOSH deployment.
In this case, the broker does its best to run any pre-delete errands configured
for the deployment. However, if the errand fails, the broker will ignore the
failure and continue with the next operation (the next pre-delete errand or the force deletion). %>
- Updates golang to v1.12.5.



### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

<ul>
    <li>The register-broker errand fails with the following error:

    <code>[register-broker] 2019/05/22 11:57:55.699337 failed to execute register-broker: planID "my-plan" not found while updating plan access</code><br><br>

    This impacts deployments that use Pivotal Application Service (PAS) because it means that they cannot register a new broker or update an existing broker.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Enterprise PKS deployments are not affected by this issue.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
     The <code>deregister-broker</code> errand fails when the broker does not exist.
   </li>
   <li>
     The <code>delete-all-service-instances</code> and <code>delete-all-service-instances-and-deregister-broker</code> errands fail when encountering a service instance that is already being deleted.
   </li>
    <li>
     Errors caused by JSON Schema Validation during create, update, and bind errands are not surfaced to the platform user.
    </li>
</ul>
