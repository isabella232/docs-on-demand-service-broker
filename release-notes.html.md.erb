## <a id="0-24-0"></a>v0.24.0

**Release Date: November 14, 2018**


<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> Service Instances
API configuration has moved from the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code>
errand to the broker job.
For more information, see <strong>Features</strong> below.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> The service adapter
  method <code>GenerateManifest()</code> takes a new parameter, <code>previousSecrets</code>.
  This parameter contains secrets from the previously deployed service instance manifest.</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- The `orphan-deployments` errand can use the Service Instances API. This
change only impacts brokers that are installed without Cloud Foundry. The
configuration for this was previously on the `update-all-service-instances`
errand, and has been moved to the broker job. <br><br>The same
configuration is used for both the `orphan-deployments` and `upgrade-all`
errands.
- Upgrades the CredHub CLI library to enable use with both v1 and v2 CredHub servers.
This is required to use Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.4 and later.
- Upgrades golang to v1.11.2.
- Adds the parameter `previousSecrets` to the `GenerateManifest()` method in
the Service Adapter.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* An issue with BOSH CredHub v1.9.11 and v2.1.5 causes an error after clicking **Apply Changes**.
  These versions of CredHub are included in Ops Manager v2.2.21, v2.3.15, v2.4.9, and v2.5.2.<br><br>
  To avoid this error, use CredHub v1.9.12 or later (included in Ops Manager v2.2.22
  or later and v2.3.16 or later) or CredHub v2.1.6 (included in Ops Manager v2.4.10
  or later and v2.5.3 or later).
  For more information about this error, see [Unable to Render Templates for Job CredHub](troubleshooting.html#credhub-error).
* Contacting the BOSH Director links API many times in parallel can cause some requests to fail during operations such as bind and unbind.

### Minimum Version Requirements

The following are minimum version requirements for this release:

- BOSH v266.12.0 or v267.6.0 and later
- Cloud Foundry v238 and later

For Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) version support, see [Product Snapshot](./index.html#product-snapshot).
