This guide is for people who want to author service tiles for <%= vars.platform_name %>
using the on-demand services SDK, part of the <%= vars.platform_name %> Services SDK.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

<%= vars.platform_name %> operators make software services such as databases available to developers
by using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> **Installation Dashboard** to install service tiles.

On-demand services let you provision instances in a flexible way.
The operator does not pre-allocate a block of VMs for the instance pool,
and they can specify an allowable range rather than fixed settings for instance resource levels.
When a developer creates an on-demand service instance, they then provision it at creation time.

The on-demand services SDK provides a generic, on-demand broker (<%= vars.product_abbr %>).
This simplifies broker and tile authoring,
and is the standard approach for both Pivotal internal services teams and Pivotal
partner independent software vendors (ISVs) to develop on-demand services for <%= vars.platform_name %>.
For more information about service brokers and how the on-demand broker works within <%= vars.platform_name %>, see
[About On-Demand Brokers](./about.html).

## <a id='new-features'></a>Key Features

The benefits of provisioning service instances with resources on-demand are:

* Operators can scale resource consumption in line with need, without having to plan for pre-provisioning.
* App developers get more control over resources and do not have to acquire them through the operator.

The benefits of using <%= vars.product_abbr %> to develop on-demand services are:

* <%= vars.product_abbr %> reduces the amount of code service developers have to write by abstracting away functionality common to most single-tenant on-demand service brokers.
* <%= vars.product_abbr %> uses BOSH to deploy service instances, so anything that is BOSH-deployable can integrate with Cloud Foundry's services Marketplace.

<%= vars.product_abbr %> uses the following BOSH features:

* Dynamic IP management
* Availability zones
* Globally-defined resources (**Cloud Config**).
This results in manifests that are portable across BOSH Cloud Provider Interfaces (CPIs) and are substantially smaller than old-style manifests.
* Links between deployed BOSH instances consuming information from other instances, for example, IP addresses.
