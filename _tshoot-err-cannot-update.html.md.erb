  Their service instance might not be running the latest service offering.
</p>

<p>
  Operators must run the <code>upgrade-all-service-instances</code> errand after upgrading
  to ensure all existing service instances are upgraded to the latest service offering. Operators
  must also configure <code>maintenance_info</code>.
  If you do not upgrade all service instances, app developers cannot:
  <ul>
    <li>Set parameters</li>
    <li>Change plans</li>
    <li>Upgrade individual service instances to use the latest service offering</li>
  </ul>
  For more information, see <a href="#upgrade-all">Upgrade All Service Instances</a>
  and <a href="./tile.html#maintenance">(Optional) Configure Maintenance Information</a>.
